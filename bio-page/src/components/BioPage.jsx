        <p>
          I'm a dedicated Computer Science student at COMSATS University
          Islamabad, driven by curiosity and a desire to innovate in the world
          of technology. My technical toolkit includes Java, Python, C++, and
          MySQL, which Iâ€™ve applied to build projects ranging from basic
          applications to backend systems. With a growing focus on Web
          Development, Software Engineering, and Artificial Intelligence, I'm
          constantly exploring how technology can solve real-world problems.
        </p>
        <p>
          Beyond the classroom, I actively contribute to university societies,
          engaging in teamwork, leadership, and creative problem-solving. Iâ€™ve
          helped organize tech events, participated in coding competitions, and
          attended industry bootcamps to sharpen both my technical and soft
          skills.
